# Face Mask Detection with Machine Learning

In this project, we explore a host of learning algorithms in an attempt to create a classifier that is able to discern whether a human is 1) wearing a mask correctly, 2) wearing a mask incorrectly, and 3) not wearing a mask. 

#### Datasets
We make use of a subset of the images made avaialable through the following datasets
- Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset (FFHQ): The dataset consists of 70,000 high-quality PNG images at 1024Ã—1024 resolution and contains considerable variation in terms of age, ethnicity and image background.
- MaskedFaceNet:  This dataset consists of human faces with a correctly or incorrectly worn mask (137,016 images) based on the dataset Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ)
- Kaggle Face Mask Detection: This dataset consists of 850 images of people wearing real masks correctly and incorrectly of people not weaing masks. The images do not come in a uniform size and do not contain a single subject, but annotation is provided for separation.

We combined a subset of FFHQ and MaskedFaceNet datasets to get a corpus (with ~4000 images) of people in all three categories. We used the entire Kaggle Face Maske Detection dataset as a second resource for testing and training. Our datasets can be found at https://stanford.app.box.com/folder/126299596483.

### Usage 
Requirements:
We recommend using python3 and a virtual env. Run the follow commands:
```sh
$ virtualenv -p python3 .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r code/requirements.txt
```

### Todos
